# Description
This folder contains the Helm charts needed to deploy Airlock IAM together with Airlock Microgateway 4.0 and above.

Each folder contains charts tailored towards a specific version of Airlock IAM.

All charts come with predefined Deny Rule exceptions to ensure smooth interoperability between IAM and Microgateway.

## Disclaimer

The charts are not yet production-ready.

Instead, they serve to demonstrate how one can configure Airlock Microgateway 4.0 to protect Airlock IAM.
